This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
This project uses [nextauth](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/example) and [prisma with postgres](https://vercel.com/guides/nextjs-prisma-postgres). 

After you configure the necessary keys, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

1. You can directly browse to a subreddit with http://localhost:3000/r/subreddit
2. to browse to a multireddit you join all subreddits with a %2b. e.g. For cats dogs and funny you would do http://localhost:3000/r/cats%2bdogs%2bfunny
